SELECT	country,

	--1 . Evaluate the FROM Clause


	--typical mistake
SELECT country, YEAR(hiredate) AS yearhired
FROM HR.Employees
WHERE yearhired >= 2003;
--should use YEAR(hiredate) >= 2003 better hiredate >= '20030101'


--Note that an alias created by the SELECT phase isnt even visible to other expressions that
--appear in the same SELECT list. For example, the following query isnt valid.
--!!!!!!!  TODO Meaning?????
SELECT empid, country, YEAR(hiredate) AS yearhired, YEAR(hiredate) - 1 AS prevyear

-- alias for table

--alias for column
-- bug
SELECT empid, firstname lastname
FROM HR.Employees;

-- right way 
SELECT empid, firstname AS lastname
FROM HR.Employees;

SELECT empid,  lastname = firstname

--redefime attribute name
SELECT empid AS employeeid, firstname, lastname

-- non relational
SELECT empid, firstname + N' ' + lastname
