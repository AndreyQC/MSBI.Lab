	(

	);

SELECT

	productname,
	unitprice
FROM Production.Products
WHERE unitprice =

SELECT 
	productid,
	productname,
	unitprice
FROM Production.Products
WHERE supplierid IN
	(
		SELECT supplierid
		FROM Production.Suppliers
		WHERE country = N'Japan'

	--Correlated Subqueries

SELECT 
	categoryid,

	productname,
	unitprice
FROM Production.Products AS P1
	WHERE unitprice =
		(
			SELECT MIN(unitprice)
			FROM Production.Products AS P2
			WHERE P2.categoryid = P1.categoryid
		);


-- common practice
/*
EXISTS doesnt need to return the result set of the subquery; rather, it
returns only true or false, depending on whether the subquery returns any rows. For this reason,
the SQL Server Query Optimizer ignores the SELECT list of the subquery, and therefore,
whatever you specify there will not affect optimization choices like index selection.
